# Ruby Exercises
Note: we're looking for Ruby commands for the below questions, not the actual answers, unless it's a question. 

Hint: you can type "irb" in your terminal to get a Ruby console to test things out. For multi-line code, use an editor that can run Ruby code, or copy/paste into irb.

Hint 2: you can refer to the Ruby doc for Array and Hash here:
